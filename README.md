Javascript Review

<b>Classes</b> are templates for objects.
Javascript calls a <b>constructor method</b> when we create a new instance of a class.
<b>Inheritance</b> is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes.
We use the <b>extends</b> keyword to create a subclass.
The super keyword calls the constructor() of a parent class.
Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.
